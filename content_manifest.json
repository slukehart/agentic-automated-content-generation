Lai, the founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper, has been detained since December 2020 under Hong Kong's national security law, facing charges of collusion with foreign forces and sedition. His case has become a symbol of the erosion of press freedom in Hong Kong following Beijing's crackdown on dissent. Trump, speaking at a recent event, described Lai as a 'good man' and called for his immediate release, emphasizing the importance of free speech. This statement marks a rare intervention by Trump on Hong Kong issues since leaving office. Lai's trial, delayed multiple times, is ongoing, and he faces a potential life sentence if convicted. International human rights groups and Western governments have repeatedly called for his release, citing concerns over judicial independence in Hong Kong. According to the BBC, Lai's case continues to draw global attention as a test of the city's autonomy under Chinese rule. This development underscores the ongoing tensions between China and the West over human rights and democratic values.",
